# When I had troubles with pycairo package I work around like this:
1. Download the latest (the last one) wheel file from this link 👉 [wheel file for package](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
2. I'd recommend saving that wheel file in the directory where you've installed Python i.e somewhere in Local Disk C.
3. Then visit the folder where the wheel file exists and run pip install <*wheel file's name*>
