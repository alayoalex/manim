## Alexei Alayo note

# When I had troubles with pycairo package I work around like this:
1. Download the latest (the last one) wheel file from this link ðŸ‘‰ [wheel file for package](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
2. I'd recommend saving that wheel file in the directory where you've installed Python i.e somewhere in Local Disk C.
3. Then visit the folder where the wheel file exists and run 
>> pip install <*wheel file's name*>
